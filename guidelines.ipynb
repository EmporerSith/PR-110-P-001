    "# An Introduction to Association Rules in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Association rules is a rule-based learning method used to draw frequent patterns and correlations from datasets such as transactional and relational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In essence it computes the co-occurence statistics between items, in the form of an implication expression (X → Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For instance, in customer basket analysis, {diaper} → {beer} means if diaper is bought, then beer is put into basket.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4 fundamental concepts in association rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *(Not a Rule)* Support: number of times X occurs over all instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Support(X→Y) is the probability of co-occurence of both items within all data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confidence(X→Y) is the probability of Y occurs given that X is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lift(X→Y) is the probability of Y being bought given that X is present, taking into account the popularity of Y as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conviction(X→Y) is the measure of implication. A value > 1 indicates that Y is highly depending on X.\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically it is probability/statistics. A simple but useful decision making tool for a wide range of usages such as market basket analysis, customer relationship management, recommender system, marketing activities, network traffic analysis, intrusion detection (fraud & malware detection) and bioinformatics.\n"
